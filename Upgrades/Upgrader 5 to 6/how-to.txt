Thank you for your interest in PHPVibe!

Upload SQL upgrader v5-v6/dbupgrade.php to your server, the file should be placed in your cms's root
in the same folder as load.php file.
Open www.yourdomain.com/dbupgrade.php (type your domain correctly) and the file should inform on applying some queries.

Now the database of PHPVibe v5 is upgraded to PHPVibes v6

You just need the file uploads and the storage changes.

Storage paths changes are as follows:

/media -> /storage/media/
/cache -> /storage/
/lib/langs/ -> /storage/langs/
/uploads/ -> /storage/uploads/
