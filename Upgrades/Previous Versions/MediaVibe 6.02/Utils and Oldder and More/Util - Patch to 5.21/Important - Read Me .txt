Edit: Added a few more changes in v5.21
Affected files:
- index.php and  /moderator/sef.php
Changed default permalinks for category and channels, removed :section for 404 removal.
You can also do this in Settings- > Permalinks, remove :Section from the Category and Profile urls.



Thank you for upgrading to v5.2

BEFORE you upgrade PLEASE:
1. Backup
2. Export your language files and place them safely on your hardrive.
IF YOU DON'T YOU WILL LOOSE YOUR LANGUAGES! 
3. phpvibe_app.js is overwriten for a small change in the loader (just seconds)
you may want to protect your original one (or reverse it from the backup) if it has changes.

v5.20 will move the languages from the database to .json files to reduce server load on the sql.

More changes:
- Added hash ids (like Youtube) for main media page's ids.
- Added Flexbox as images lightbox
- Added "required" to edit form's title.
- Improved some cached queries
- Html cache improvements
- Started optimizing some code for the v6 upgrade
  Split code to new files (from functions to functions.permalinks.php)
- Fixed a sidebar notice for no colections.
- Changed some links in providers from http to https  
- Improved thumb_fix to detect links starting with "//"
- Changed the homeloader time to lower value (This made many think the website is slow :) )

On https:
A quick sql fix for the users having issues on https with some thumbs:
Run this video phpmyadmin, replace vibe_ with your existing prefix.
update vibe_videos
set thumb = replace(thumb, 'http://', '//');
update vibe_users
set avatar = replace(avatar, 'http://', '//');
